## Section Guidance

### Pitch

- Single sentence that captures the essence
- Format: WHO it's for, WHAT problem it solves, HOW it helps
- Should be memorable and shareable

### Users

- **Primary Customers**: High-level segments
- **User Personas**: Detailed profiles with context, pain points, goals
- Focus on real use cases and motivations

### The Problem

- Articulate the problem clearly
- Include quantifiable impact where possible
- Connect solution directly to problem

### Differentiators

- What makes you different from alternatives
- Should be specific and measurable
- Focus on unique advantages that matter to users

### Key Features

- Organize by category (Core, Collaboration, Advanced, etc.)
- **Focus on user benefits**, not technical implementation
- Each feature should answer "What can users do?" not "How is it built?"

## Writing Tips

1. **User-Centric Language**: Write from user perspective
2. **Concrete Examples**: Use specific scenarios, not abstractions
3. **Quantifiable Impact**: Include metrics where possible
4. **Scannable Format**: Use bullets, headers, and short paragraphs
5. **Action-Oriented**: Focus on what users can accomplish

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Describing technical implementation instead of user benefits
- ❌ Using jargon that users won't understand
- ❌ Making vague claims without specifics
- ❌ Forgetting to differentiate from alternatives
- ❌ Writing too much - keep it concise
