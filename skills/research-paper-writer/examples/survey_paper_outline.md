## Paper: A Survey of Context-Aware Systems Engineering

### Title and Abstract

**Title:** Engineering Context-Aware Systems: A Comprehensive Survey

**Abstract (150-250 words):**
Context-aware systems have become increasingly important in ubiquitous computing environments. However, engineering such systems poses significant challenges in requirements elicitation, design, implementation, and validation. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of engineering practices for context-aware systems, examining 47 approaches across four lifecycle phases. We provide a taxonomy of techniques for context modeling, adaptation mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Our analysis reveals key trends including the rise of machine learning-based adaptation, increasing emphasis on privacy-preserving context handling, and the emergence of systematic requirements engineering approaches. We identify open challenges and propose future research directions for the field.
